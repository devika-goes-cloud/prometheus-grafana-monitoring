# Prometheus and Grafana Monitoring Setup to monitor system and website metrics

This project shows the steps to set up **Prometheus** for monitoring and **Grafana** for visualization.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Prometheus Setup

1. Installed Prometheus.
2. Installed and configured **Node Exporter** to collect system-level metrics (CPU, memory, disk, etc.) on the target machines.
3. Installed and configured **Blackbox Exporter** to monitor website and service availability by probing endpoints.
4. Configured Prometheus `prometheus.yml` to scrape metrics from targets.
5. Verified Prometheus is running on port `9090`.

## üìä Grafana Setup

1. Installed Grafana.  
2. Added Prometheus as a data source in Grafana.
3. Imported and customized dynamic, full-featured dashboards to visualize system and website metrics effectively.
4. Created dashboards for CPU, memory, disk usage, network stats (via Node Exporter), and HTTP probe results (via Blackbox Exporter).
